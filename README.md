## architecture

The project follows a modular architecture where each tool is isolated in its own directory under `lib/tools`. This makes it easy to add new tools and maintain existing ones.

- `lib/core`: Shared widgets, themes, and constants.
- `lib/models`: Data models.
- `lib/providers`: Riverpod providers for state management.
- `lib/screens`: Main screens of the app (e.g., `HomeScreen`).
- `lib/services`: Business logic for the tools.
- `lib/tools`: Individual tool modules, each containing its own screen, widgets, and services.
- `lib/utils`: Utility functions.
